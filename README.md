# Welcome to AI Shahab

<a href="https://chatcas.ir/"><img src="image.jpg" alt="icon" style="height: 16px; vertical-align: center;"></a> [CAS 2](https://chatcas.ir) is an independently developed generative AI model designed to transform poetic and surreal prompts into coherent, ultra-detailed visual scenes. CAS 2 bridges Persian aesthetics, impossible geometry, and cinematic realism — pushing the boundaries of open-source creative AGI.

## Research
* [CAS 2](https://github.com/ai-shahab/cas2): a next-generation generative vision model engineered to translate surreal, poetic, and mathematically impossible prompts into ultra-detailed, coherent images. CAS 2 combines quantum geometry, Persian aesthetics, and cinematic lighting — positioning itself as a creative step toward AGI.
* [CAS-Vision](https://github.com/ai-shahab/cas-vision): an open-source image generation model specialized in visualizing abstract, symbolic, and fractal-rich prompts. CAS-Vision expands the CAS framework into the visual domain, blending Persian miniature aesthetics, physically-impossible geometry, and cinematic photorealism.
* [CAS-R1](https://github.com/ai-shahab/cas-r1): explored reinforcement learning for aligning large language models with multi-modal perception and abstract reasoning. We released a technical report detailing CAS-R1's training pipeline and evaluation benchmarks.
* [CAS-Light](https://github.com/ai-shahab/cas-light): includes (i) checkpoints for compact SOTA image-text models; (ii) source code for a novel optimizer tuned for creative prompt interpretation and fast convergence.
* [CAS-Long](https://github.com/ai-shahab/cas-long): features a custom long-context attention mechanism designed to handle abstract visual-language prompts with high temporal and structural complexity.
* [CAS-VL](https://github.com/ai-shahab/cas-vl): Mixture-of-Experts Vision-Language Model tuned for artistic prompt understanding, cinematic storytelling, and high-fidelity multimodal reasoning.
* [CAS-Prover Preview](https://github.com/ai-shahab/cas-prover-preview): Towards Large Formal Reasoning Models with Multi-Step Derivation Capabilities. Includes our technical report, open-source weights, and a refined benchmark for symbolic logic and mathematical inference.
* [CAS-Dev](https://github.com/ai-shahab/cas-dev): A High-performance Coding LLM optimized for automatic issue triage, patch generation, and reasoning over complex codebases. CAS-Dev-42B achieves 58.7% on SWE-bench Verified.

## API Service

* [CAS-Palace](https://github.com/ai-shahab/cas-palace): internal debugging and monitoring tool for the CAS-API service.
