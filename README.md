# Welcome to AI Shahab

<a href="https://chatcas.ir/"><img src="image.jpg" alt="icon" style="height: 16px; vertical-align: center;"></a> [CAS 2](https://chatcas.ir) is an independently developed generative AI model designed to transform poetic and surreal prompts into coherent, ultra-detailed visual scenes. CAS 2 bridges Persian aesthetics, impossible geometry, and cinematic realism — pushing the boundaries of open-source creative AGI.

## Research
* [CAS 2](https://github.com/ai-shahab/cas2): a next-generation generative vision model engineered to translate surreal, poetic, and mathematically impossible prompts into ultra-detailed, coherent images. CAS 2 combines quantum geometry, Persian aesthetics, and cinematic lighting — positioning itself as a creative step toward AGI.
* [CAS-Vision](https://github.com/ai-shahab/cas-vision): an open-source image generation model specialized in visualizing abstract, symbolic, and fractal-rich prompts. CAS-Vision expands the CAS framework into the visual domain, blending Persian miniature aesthetics, physically-impossible geometry, and cinematic photorealism.
